\begin{lemma}
    The roots of a polynomial $y = ax^{2}+bx+c$ are given by 
		\[
		x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}
		\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    If you would like to find a percent $r$ of a value $P$, you can use the formula 
		\[
		A = Pr
		\]
		If you would like to increase $P$ by a certain percent $r$, you can use 
		\[
		A = P(1+r)
		\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	The simple interest formula is given by 
    \[
    A = P(1+rt)
    \]
		The compound interest formula compounded yearly is given by 
		\[
		A = P(1+r)^{t} 
		\]
		The compound interest formula compounded $n$-times yearly is given by 
		\[
		A = P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}
		\]
		Here $A$ is the amount of money you end with, $P$ is the starting value, $r$ is the rate , and $t$ is the number of years. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $P$ be the amount of a loan at an interest rate $r$, with $n$-payments per year over $t$ years. Then size of the payment is given by 
	\[
	\frac{P(\frac{r}{n})}{\left[1-\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{-nt}\right]}
	\]

\question Solve the following linear equation 
\[
2(x-3)-2 = 3-3(x+2) 
\]
\begin{solution}
    \begin{align*}
        2(x-3)-2 = 3-3(x+2)\\
				2x-6 - 2 & = 3 -3x-6 \\
				2x-8 & = -3x-3 \\
				2x & = -3x +5 \\

\question The formula 
\[
C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)
\]
expresses the relationship between Farenheit temperature, $F$, and Celsius temperate $C$. Evaluate the expression at $F = 41$ to find the equivalent temperature at the Celsius scale. 
\begin{solution}
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{align*}
			C &= \frac{5}{9}(41-32)\\
			C & = \frac{5}{9}(9) \\
			C & = 5 \\

\question Solve the quadratic equation by factoring 
\[
x^{2}-2x-15 = 0 
\]
\begin{solution}
     \begin{align*}
			 0 & = x^{2}-2x-15 \\
			& = (x-5)(x+3)\\
     \end{align*} 
		 Therefore, $x=5$ and $x = -3$
\end{solution}

\question Solve the following quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. 
\[
x^{2}+5x - 4 = 0

\question  You are considering buying a Traeger Grill for your parents for Christmas. The Pro 780 model costs $999.95$ at Ace Hardware. The sales tax at Ace Hardware in Yankton is $6.2\%$. 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \alph*)]
	\item How much sales tax do you pay in total on your purchase? 
	\item What is the total cost of the grill? 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = \alph*)]
			\item The amount of sales tax $T$ is given by 
				\[
				T = 999.95 (0.062)
				\]
			\item The total cost of the grill $C$ is given by 
				\[
				C = 999.95 (1.062)
				\]
    \end{enumerate}

\question You are looking to invest $2000$ dollars. A bank gives you two options. You can either invest into an account that gives simple interest at $10\%$ per year, or you can invest in an account that makes $8\% $ compound interest. 
\begin{enumerate}[label = \alph*)]
	\item After $4$ years, which account is the better investment? 
	\item After $8$ years, which account is the better investment? 
	\item Which account will be the better investment in the short term? Why is this? 
	\item Which account will be the better investment in the long run? Why is this? 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = \alph*)]
			\item The amount after $4$ years with the simple interest is given by 
				\[
				2000 (1+0.1(4)) = 2000*1.4 = 2800
				\]
				The amount after $4$ years with compound interest is given by 
				\[
					2000(1.08)^{4}= \approx 2720.98
				\]
				Therefore the account with simple interest is best after $4$ years. 
				\item The amount after $8$ years with the simple interest is given by 
				\[
				2000 (1+0.1(8)) = 2000*1.8 = 3600
				\]
				The amount after $4$ years with compound interest is given by 
				\[
					2000(1.08)^{8}= \approx 3701.86
				\]
				Therefore the account with compound interest is best after $4$ years. 
			\item The simple interest is better in the short term. After only one year for example, they both calculate interest in the same way, by multiplying by the interest rate. Therefore, the higher interest rate will be better. 
			\item In the long run, the compound interest rate will be better since we take $8\%$ of whatever money we have at a given time. Therefore, once we have more than $2500$ dollars, the compound interest at $8\%$ will make more than the $10\%$ of $2000$ dollars. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
    \question Assume that you buy a new car that costs $\$25000$ dollars. You finance it with a $3$ year loan at $4\%$. Assume you make monthly payments. What is the monthly payment for your car loan? 
		\begin{solution}
	    \[
	PMT = \frac{25000(\frac{0.04}{12})}{\left[1-\left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)^{-12*3}\right]}
	    \]
			Which is about $\$738.10$
		\end{solution}
